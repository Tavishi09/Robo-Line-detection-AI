# Robo-Line-detection-AI
using image processing and openCV
• Developed a robust line detection algorithm for real-world environments that effectively detect border lines in noisy tile images
• Implemented Gaussian Blur, contrast stretching, Canny edge detection algorithms to enhance & accurately detect border lines
• Successfully applied robotics principles to solve practical challenges in tile arrangement in a dataset of 5000+ images
